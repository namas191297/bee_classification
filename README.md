# Bee Classification - Apis and Bombus

This notebook walks through building a simple deep learning model that can automatically detect honey bees and bumble bees and then loads a pre-trained model for evaluation.

Being able to identify bee species from images is a task that ultimately would allow researchers to more quickly and effectively collect field data. Pollinating bees have critical roles in both ecology and agriculture, and diseases like colony collapse disorder threaten these species. Identifying different species of bees in the wild means that we can better understand the prevalence and growth of these important insects.
